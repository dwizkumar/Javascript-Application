Project Name: Make and guess your drink

Description: The application generates dynamic select drop-down based on the dataset and selected inputs. Once the user reaches to the leaf node(last drop-down), based on the selected option, user will get a quiz question with 3 different options for the selected option. For example, if the choice of spirit is Tequila, then a user will get 3 options like Summer Blush, Black Widow, and Tennessee Devil. Out of all three only one option is actually a drink based on Tequila, remaining are either Vodka or Whiskey. This makes options bit difficult to guess since all the options are of Spirit type. Since this quiz is for fun, users are given multiple attempts to guess a correct drink. Once the user selects a correct drink, the application generates a form for the user to save the first name and last name. Further, the application saves the user's selected choice along with first name, last name in either local storage or cookies for further reference. Next time, when user visit, they can see the last selected drink if the user provides the same first name and last name.
